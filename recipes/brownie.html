            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>One of my all time favorite foods has always been Hamburgers. Ever since I had my first bite, I fell in love.
                </p>
                <p>Here you will find a recipe of a basic Steakhouse Burger. You can modify it many ways, always try new things.
                </p>
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <ul type = "-"></ul>
                <li>2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into ¼-inch pieces</li>
                <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
                <li>2½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>3 pounds 80 to 85% lean ground beef</li>
                <li>3 scallions, very finely sliced (optional)</li>
                <li>8 hamburger buns </li>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                 <li>Preheat the grill to high heat.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well.
                </li>
                <li>Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands. Mix everything together until evenly combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and form compact balls. Flatten the balls into ¾-inch patties about 4½ inches across. Form a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.</li>
                <li>Oil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached. Before serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired</li>
                 </ol>
            <h4>Freezer-Friendly Instructions:</h4>
                <p>The uncooked burgers can be frozen for up to three months. (Freeze the burgers on a baking sheet or plate so their shape sets, then transfer them to a sealable plastic bag for easy storage.) Defrost the burgers overnight in the refrigerator prior to serving and then cook as directed.</p>
