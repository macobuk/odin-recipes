            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <ul type = "-"></ul>
                <li>10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, natural or Dutch-process</li>
                <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt, use slightly less if using fine sea or table salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2/3 cup (75 grams) chopped walnuts or pecans, optional</li>
               
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <h4>PREPARE BATTER</h4>
                <ol>
                 <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
                <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering. See the notes section below for tips on making these without a double-boiler and instead using a microwave or making them directly in a saucepan.</li>
                <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
                <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
                <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes</li>
                <li>Stir in nuts if using.</li></ol>
            
                <h4>BAKE BROWNIES</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
                <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan — this step is essential and helps the brownies set. Cut into 16 squares. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
                <p><h5>Baking pan:</h5> We love our USA Pan 8×8-inch metal pan for this recipe. Glass and ceramic pans work, but keep in mind that they may affect bake time. Check on doneness 5 minutes early and every 5 minutes after that.
                   <h5> Using a microwave: </h5>Combine butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl, and then microwave for 20-second increments until the butter melts into the sugar. Make sure that you stir the mixture in between microwaving.
                   <h5> Using a saucepan instead of a double-boiler:</h5> The double-boiler is a fail-safe against scorching the batter; however, you can combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir the mixture until the butter melts into the sugar.</p>
